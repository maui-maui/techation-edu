  Welcome to base systems class. This will be an introductory class to 
base systems. If you don't know what base systems are they are basically 
another name for number systems for example we most commonly use base 10 
which we call by another name, Decimal system, which is a number system 
that counts from 0-9 until it hit 2 place values i.e. the decimal number 
10.

  We won't cover all base-systems in these lessons but we will start off 
with these

base 1
base 2
base 3 (maybe)
base 10 (briefly)
base 16

  We won't necessarily go in this order. In fact base 1 and base 10 will 
be put together in one lesson since they are really simple and you 
already know the fundaments to both these systems. Then we will carry 
onto base 2 and base 16 which is when we will incorporate 'ASCII' into 
the lessons. And finally we might conclude with base 3. By this time you 
should get the gist of how to figure out bases because the fundaments 
can be applied to all the bases. So without further ado... Lesson 1
