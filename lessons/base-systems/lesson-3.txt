  Welcome to lesson 3 of introduction to base systems, 

In this lesson we will be going over base 16. Which may seem a bit 
complicated at first but after you start understanding it you won't have 
much of an issue figuring out the rest. So to start off, base 16 has 16 
different digits just like base 10 has 10 and base 2 has 2. These digits how 
ever bring in letters too. Which may seem weird but they basically just 
represent a number so its not to complicated. We have...

A
B
C
D
E
F

  With the letters from 'A' to 'F' can be interpreted as follows:

A = 10
B = 11
C = 12
D = 13
E = 14
F = 15

  So to jump right in our place values are:
