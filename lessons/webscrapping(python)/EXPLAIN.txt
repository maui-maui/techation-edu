Welcome to web-scraping!

This will explain getting the information you need on websites

Please note, you will need to change some things, depending on the site
I will be using backpack.tf as an example

(Please look at the code while reading this)

Also, at the end I use f-strings. If you are using 3.5 or below, you will have to
change them to .format

To get started, open your terminal. On windows, this is cmd
type in: pip install requests
and: pip install bs4

(This is not in the code, you must do this yourself)

First we import our packages, and set out site url to webSite
Then, We use requests to get the website information

Because requests returns an object, we must use page.content to get the string
of the raw html code

(From here on, it depends on your site. the find_all will differ, and the attributes (if any) will also vary)

Now that we have a BuetifulSoup object with the site, we use find_all('p',{'class':'value'})

The 'p' defines that we want every html tag, thats a p tag. Then we use the dict to find every 'p' tag that
has the attribute class, which is equall to value

It will return another object, which we can get the text that isn't in a tag from, by doing the text.text, where text is a tag

Now, we also got the key, ref, and bud tags classes, which we can get attributes from, as-if it was a dict

Then we print it out, and BOOM! Magic!
