  First you can choose to follow me here and get code snippets but at 
the end of each lesson I'll put a file organized by names and folders of 
how to organize it, and add addition comments along the way so look at 
both or just the lesson-1.py file.

Right now before we get started we need to make a few folders and files.

Bot-folder
|
|-->botfile.py
|
|-->cogsfolder
    |
    |-->test.py
|
|-->datafolder
    |
    |-->secrets.json

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

{IN OUR BOTFILE.PY}
  To get started we are gonna import a few libraries

    from discord.ext import commands
    import json
    import asyncio

  First off we import `from discord.ext import commands` for our bot 
  discord.ext commands. Next we have json because we are gonna make a 
  file.json soon which we will go over then. And last but not least we 
  import asyncio for the asyncio stuff which we will see shortly.

  After that we are gonna add the following code. (This is where our 
  json library comes in handy) 

        with open('datafolder/secrets.json', 'r') as f:
          secrets = json.loads(f.read())

  This comes more into play when we get to SECRETS.JSON section. next we 
  will add our variables we will be using for this file.

        token = secrets['token']
        prefix = secrets['prefix']
        bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix=prefix)

  Now we will do our first bot event.

    @bot.event
    async def on_ready():
        print('\n################')
        print("Bot is online!")
        print('################')
        print('Logged in as:')
        print(bot.user.name)
        print(bot.user.id)
        print('Prefix: ', prefix)
        print('#################\n')

  This will print that info to your terminal or console when your bot is 
  online. Next this part will be to load the TEST.py cog in COGSFOLDER 
  so take note for now.

        #### <-- LOADING COGS --> ####
        bot.load_extension('cogs.test')
        print("COG TEST LOADED")

  And now finally in the end of the code goes

        bot.run(token)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

{IN OUR SECRETS.JSON}
  So now in our SECRETS.JSON is the 3 things we got from our bot app 
  earlier.
