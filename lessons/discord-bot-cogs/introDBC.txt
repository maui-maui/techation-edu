  Welcome to assignment one for making a discord bot with cogs. The bot 
will be in Python 3.5 but I may slip in 3.6 on accident so its probably 
best to use the later version. As a forewarning I suck at python but I'm
getting better and soon this will all be done with ease for all of us. 
So just bare with me as we go through this course. 

  As a forewarning I don't plan on teaching python here but I will try 
to explain what I am doing in each step to the best of my abiliy. I 
would also like to inform you that in this lesson I will be teaching 
what I learn to better iterate it and if you are interested in doing 
the same let us know...

However,
